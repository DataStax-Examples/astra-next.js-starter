## Objectives
* Provide a fullstack development example using Astra as the storage backend

## How this works
Once the Astra credentials are provided, the necessary tables are created in the database and sample data is inserted. The webservice will be available on port 3000 once the application has been deployed. Once the application is running, you can begin to make changes to your app by editing `pages/index.js`.

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an open-source JavaScript framework that lets you build server-side rendering and static web applications using React. It is not nescessary to configuration of webpack or similar to start using Next.js, as it comes with its configuration. This make it very simple to start a project, as we only need to execute simple commands and the project is ready.

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions, it enables developers to host Jamstack websites and web services that deploy instantly. You also have the option to deloy this app in Vercel.
